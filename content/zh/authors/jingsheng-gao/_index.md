​ I am a first-year PhD student at SJTU EECS, advised by Prof. Yuzhuo Fu. Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from school of Physics and Astromony, Shanghai Jiaotong University.

​ I completed my undergraduate graduation project using different kinds of  U-nets, which is a astronomical task called extracting weak gravitational lens in CMB. Also, I have ever practiced in a medical company which is established by Fosun. During my first year, I have tried some projects on document understanding, like seal extraction and tabel detection.

​ In the future, I will mainly put my attention on computer version and try to catch the future development of machine learning.
