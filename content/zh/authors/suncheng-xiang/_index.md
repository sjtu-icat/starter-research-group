Hi, I am Suncheng Xiang, a final-year PhD student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

Before this, I graduated from Changsha University of Science & Technology (CSUST) for B.Eng in Electrical Engineering and Automation in 2014, then obtained the M.Eng from National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) in 2017.

My main research topics are computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, I am currently doing research works on person re-identification, domain adaptation, transfer learning and related applications. I am also interested in some image generation and image retrieval tasks, e.g. vehicle re-identification and fine-grained image retrieval tasks. 

This is my [Homepage](https://JeremyXSC.github.io).
